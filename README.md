Chrome LiveJournal ToS Hider
============================

LiveJournal recently changed their Terms of Service. Many people find the new Terms of Service unacceptable and are unwilling to accept them. Some people even find the new Terms of Service so unacceptable that not only are they unwilling to accept them, they want to go further and delete their LiveJournal accounts.

The only way to delete one's LiveJournal account is via the [Account Status page](http://www.livejournal.com/accountstatus/). Unfortunately, it's impossible to access that page without accepting the new Terms of Service, since the "NEW USER AGREEMENT" pop-up appears on every page of the LiveJournal site, preventing the user from accessing the page until they have accepted the new agreement.

Fortunately, however, this is enforced in client-side code. Here, you will find a tiny Google Chrome extension which, if you install it into Chrome and then browse the [Account Status page](http://www.livejournal.com/accountstatus/), will make the ToS pop-up go away, so that you can delete your account.

To install this extension:

1. Download the extension into a folder on your computer.
2. Open the Extensions page in Chrome, either by typing "chrome://extensions" into the URL bar or selecting the "More tools | Extensions" menu command.
3. Either drag the folder containing the extension over the Extensions page and drop it when the page says "Drop to install", or click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the extension folder.
